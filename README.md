# Data Structures in Python

## Overview

This repository focuses on implementing various data structures in Python. Data structures are essential for organizing, storing, and manipulating data efficiently in computer memory. They provide rules for how data is stored and retrieved, with different structures designed for specific purposes.

## Included Data Structures

- **Arrays:** Contiguous memory locations for storing elements.
- **Linked Lists:** Nodes linked together, allowing for dynamic data storage.
- **Stacks:** Follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queues:** Follows First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Trees:** Hierarchical structures with nodes and branches.
- **Graphs:** Representing relationships between entities.
- **Hash Tables:** Mapping keys to values using a hash function.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems. This repository may also include algorithm implementations for various tasks such as searching, sorting, pattern matching, and optimization.

## Purpose

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental for software development. This repository aims to provide practical implementations in Python, fostering comprehension and enabling the creation of efficient solutions to diverse problems.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding new data structures, improving existing implementations, or providing examples of algorithmic solutions. Together, we can build a resource that helps developers enhance their understanding of these foundational concepts.

Happy coding!
